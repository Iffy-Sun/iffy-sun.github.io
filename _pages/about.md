Welcome to my site! I'm pursuing an M.S. in Statistics at the
University of Delaware, building on my MBA and Bachelor's in Public
Finance. My background includes roles in banking, focusing on data
analysis, and auditing. I enjoy multitasking and collaboration.
Outside of work, I love reading, cooking, exploring new places, and
trying out different cuisines.
